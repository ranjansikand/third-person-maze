Third Person Maze Prototype


This is a maze I created using Unity standard assets, which can be navigated with a third person character that was designed by QuaterniusDev in Blender. The character is outfitted with a running animation, and an orbiting camera that is controlled by mouse movement.

The game is not completed, but represents a trial of specific features I was interested in working on.
